# Planning the Input<a name="planning-the-input"></a>

To plan your input, identify which individual video, audio, and captions assets that you want to extract from the input and which ones you want to omit\. For example, you must extract one video file, but you can choose to omit some captions languages\.

The rules for extracting input are the following: 

+ You must extract one and only one video file\. 

+ You can extract zero or more audio files\. Typically, you extract multiple audio files so that you can include multiple languages in the output\. But you can also extract multiple audio files to extract different audio formats, for example, AAC and Dolby Digital\. 

+ You can extract zero or more captions files\. Typically, you extract multiple captions files so that you can include multiple languages in the output\. But you can also extract multiple captions to extract different captions formats, for example, DVB\-Sub and an external file format such as SRT\.

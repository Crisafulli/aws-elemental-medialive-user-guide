Complete the Name modifier field as described in [[ERROR] BAD/MISSING LINK TEXT](smooth-group-fields.md#smooth-destinations)\.

## Streams Section<a name="smooth-streams-section"></a>

In the Stream settings section, decide if you need to create more encodes for this output, based on the workflow you planned\. By default, each output is set up with one video encode and one audio encode\. Select the appropriate Add button or Delete button to set up the output with the encodes – video, audio, captions – you planned for this output\.

For example, in one output you may want one video and two audios, in another output you may want one captions, and in a third output you may want just one captions\.

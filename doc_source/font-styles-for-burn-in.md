# Font Styles for Burn\-in or DVB\-Sub<a name="font-styles-for-burn-in"></a>

You can specify the look of the captions if the output captions are Burn\-in or DVB\-Sub\.

If you are using the same caption source in several outputs and both those outputs use the same format, then you must set up the font style information identically in each output\. If you do not, you will get an error when you save the channel\. 

For example, output A might use Caption Selector 1 with the Destination Type set to Burn\-in\. And output B might also use Caption Selector 1 with the Destination Type set to Burn\-in\. You set the font information once in output 1 and again in output 2\. But you must make sure to set up all the font information identically in both outputs\.

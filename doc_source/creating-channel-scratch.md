# Creating a Channel from Scratch<a name="creating-channel-scratch"></a>

A channel contains the details that instruct AWS Elemental MediaLive how to transcode \(decode and encode\) and package your input into specific outputs\. 

To create a channel you must provide details about inputs, about one or more output groups and their destinations, about the outputs in each output group, and about the video, audio and caption encodes in each output\.

There are three ways to create a channel: 

+ **From scratch\.** See below

+ **Using a built\-in or custom template\.** See [[ERROR] BAD/MISSING LINK TEXT](creating-channel-template-clone.md)\.

+ **By cloning an existing channel\.** See [[ERROR] BAD/MISSING LINK TEXT](creating-channel-template-clone.md)\.

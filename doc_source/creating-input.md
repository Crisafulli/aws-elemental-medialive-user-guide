# Creating Input<a name="creating-input"></a>

An input is a video asset that is to be transcoded and packaged\. The source of the video asset is the "upstream system" â€“ the system in your end\-to\-end workflow whose activities occur before those of AWS Elemental MediaLive\.  

AWS Elemental MediaLive supports specific input types\. For more information on the types, see [[ERROR] BAD/MISSING LINK TEXT](inputs-supported-containers.md)\.

You must create an AWS Elemental MediaLive input in order to provide information about the source of the video asset\.
